# JavaScript: Full Stack App with React and a REST API
 The 10th and last project on the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. This is Full Stack App with React on the client side and Express on the server side. It uses React to implement a client for a school database REST API providing a way for users to interact with this database. A user can create an account and sign in to make changes to the database, which contains information about courses.
 
  Main technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React<br>
  Auxiliary technologies: HTML, CSS<br>
  Complexity level: Advanced<br>
  Estimated Time to Complete: 40 hours<br>
  Concepts: React Authentication, React Components, React Router, React State, React Context API, HTTP Cookie, Single-page application, JSX, AJAX, REST API, Basic Authentication, JSON<br>

## For "Exceeds Requirements":
  - Redirects user to 'error handling' components in order to display user friendly error messages
  - Persists user credentials i.e. creates an HTTP cookie so the authenticated state is maintained
  - After successfully signing in, redirects the user back to the route they wanted to access in the first place

## Extras:
  - Two custom CSS rules: Hover effect on anchor elements of the Courses component (class 'course--link' and 'course--add--module') and design rule for the class 'active' created by the NavLink component)

## Instructions:
  - Download or clone the repository
  - In your text editor, open the folder 'api'
  - Run "npm install" to install all dependencies
  - Run "npm run seed" to create the initial database and seed it with initial data
  - Run "npm start" to start the server (Default @ port 5000)
  - Go back to the root folder of the project and open the folder 'client'
  - Run "npm install" to install all dependencies
  - Run "npm start" to start the application (Default @ port 3000)
